    \# \--- WARNING: Dependency Injection for Services in Celery is non-trivial \---  
    \# This approach of calling service methods directly might fail if the service  
    \# relies on FastAPI's Depends() or global state not available in the worker.  
    \# Safer approaches:  
    \# 1\. Pass all necessary data to the task, task performs direct DB/API calls.  
    \# 2\. Use Celery signals (worker_process_init) to setup DB/Redis connections per worker.  
    \# 3\. Structure services to be easily instantiated without FastAPI context.
